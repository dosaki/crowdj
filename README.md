###- read Crowd-DJ... or however else you want to, I can't really force you

At it's heart, crowdj is a simple playlist that anyone can add to.

It was born out of our DJ system at the office: Whoever gets to the jambox first gets DJ duty.
The problem with this is that you can't really listen to that awesome song you feel like listening to now!

In comes crowdj! I get DJ duty, I fire the application up and now the rest of the dev team doesn't have to always listen to my ~~weird~~ [musical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN7dYDYfvVg) [tastes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN7dYDYfvVg)!

Also, this is my first venture into node.js!


###How do you use this?!
uhm... @todo: explain
